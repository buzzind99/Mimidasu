/// runtime exports exactly five generic `dictionary_*` symbols; the string
/// literals below must match that ABI exactly. The C surface is owned by the
/// tracked `ffi/vibrato-ffi` crate; the vibrato engine behind the dylib is
/// vendored under `vendor/` at the ref pinned in `scripts/build_dictionary.sh`,
/// so the engine can be swapped without touching this file.

/// All loading is injectable (`load(openLibrary:symbol:)`) so tests can drive
/// every failure path without the dylib. Fail-soft: `load` returns nil when
/// the library or any required symbol is missing; callers degrade to plain
/// text rather than crash.
